    there was a bug and my code would not work so I modified my test case/code for the readPoly()

    fifth refactor: added a test case for the readPoly function which I originally refactored to fix a scanner leak, but later when testing had to come back and refactor quite a bit to fix a logic issue in the original code

    fourth refactoring: In this refactor I get rid of multiple bad code smells that all essentially result in code redundancy. I also add a test class and within that, test cases to show that my code is still working as intended despite the changes

    third refactoring: in this refactoring I got rid of redundant code within each case of the original switch statement by only creating an object of the processCalculationsClass() once at the start of our main branch and then re-using that object the rest of the program's runtime.
